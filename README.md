# Build4Less: Notion-Based Data Management System

How to Use:
Build4Less leverages Notion as a powerful data management system, allowing you to connect and automate backend data to seamlessly display your data on a web-based frontend. This system is ideal for managing and displaying your fully automated data dynamically on your website.

What You'll Learn? ðŸ“–
In this guide, we'll walk you through how to set up and use Notion as a lightweight Data Management System (DMS) tailored towards "business to business" (B2B) or "business to consumer" (B2C) related E-Commerce Stores. While Notion is highly flexible, it's especially effective for managing mostly static content with a few sections requiring updates. 

Hereâ€™s what you will achieve:

-Create a website: You will create a basic web site, using ViteJS and Open Props with HTML and CSS.

-Set Up Notion: Configure Notion and create an API integration to connect your Notion data with the web app.

-Deploy to Netlify: Publish your web site for free using Netlify.

- Setup Netlify Serverless Functions: Create a serverless function with the Notion SDK for JavaScript and the Netlify CLI, including setting up environment variables.

- Fetch Live Notion Data: Retrieve live data from Notion using your Netlify serverless function.

- Skeleton Loading Animation: Implement a skeleton loading animation to enhance user experience (UX) while data loads.
